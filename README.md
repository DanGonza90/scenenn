# SceneNN
We maintain the following repositories on Google Drive for our dataset:

## 1. Main
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-aa7y5Ox4eZWE8yMkRkNkU4Tk0

This includes all 90+ scenes captured by Asus Xtion PRO. 

To download the scenes from this repository, use *scenenn_download*, a Python script that can download the entire dataset or a few specific scenes. To run this script, please install [PyDrive](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyDrive). 

## 2. Beta
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2BQi-ql8CzeUkJNbEVEQkozSmc

This includes annotation for scenes that might receives some experimental updates, e.g., object poses and improvement of floor aligned camera trajectories. Such annotation will be merged to the main repository once they are stable. 

This repository also includes scenes captured by both Asus Xtion PRO and Kinect v2. 

Please refer to our project page at http://www.scenenn.net for the papers and scene previews in the supplementary document.
